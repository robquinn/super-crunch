# This file specifies files that are _not_ uploaded to Google Cloud
# using gcloud. It follows the same syntax as .gitignore, with the addition of
# "#!include" directives (which insert the entries of the given .gitignore-style
# file at that point).

# For more information, run:
# $ gcloud topic gcloudignore
